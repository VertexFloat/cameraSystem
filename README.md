## About the project

<img src='screenshots/screenShot (1).png' alt='screenshot'>

This modification gives the possibility of adding cameras, e.g. a discharge pipe camera or a rear view camera. You can easily switch between added cameras which are displayed as HUD.
As standard, some of the originally available vehicles were equipped with camera configurations.
<br/>
<br />
Change camera system mode (off/always on/only when reversing) - 'y' key (default)
<br/>
Next/previous camera - 'left shift + k/m' keys (default)

ATTENTION !
- to activate the camera system, the vehicle must have their configuration added,
- the image quality of the cameras is the highest I could set, so please bear with me.
